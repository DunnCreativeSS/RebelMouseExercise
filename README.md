# RebelMouseExercise

As we discussed, I would love to understand a little bit about your skills with HMTL / CSS / JS.


Could you please send me the implementation of this screen? https://jmp.sh/Z84IQLN 




Just some extra information:


1. The top bar doesn’t need to be functional


2. The search doesn’t need to work


3. I would love to see your implementation for the slideshow (it should work, when I click on it I want to be able to see the pictures)


The implementation should be responsive (work for mobile, desktop, tablet)



Please let me know when you think you can send me this and if you have any questions.



thank you!
